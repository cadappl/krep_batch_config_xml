Configuration Demo for `krep batch`
===================================

The file `project.xml` is the demonstrated configuration file for [krep]
sub-command `batch`. The file can be used as the arguement for the command:

```sh
$ krep batch -f project.xml
```

Now the file contains three projects:

- Linux kernel
- Android AOSP
- Android CM

The main reference can be the usage of the project *Android CM*, which
contains lots of patterns.
